This project is fully containerized and includes a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy setup. You can run the entire application with a single command.

### Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine.

### Instructions

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AashutoshDubey619/Firangi.git](https://github.com/AashutoshDubey619/Firangi.git)
    cd Firangi
    ```

2.  **Create your environment file:**
    This project uses an `.env` file for secrets. An example is provided; you can copy it to get started.
    ```bash
    # For Windows (in Command Prompt)
    copy example.env .env

    # For Windows (in PowerShell)
    Copy-Item example.env .env

    # For Mac/Linux
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    
3.  **Edit your `.env` file:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in all your secrets (your `ATLASDB_URL`, `CLOUDINARY_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_SECRET`, etc.).

4.  **Run the application:**
    This command will build the Docker image, download the dependencies, and start the application.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    
The application will be available at **`http://localhost:8081`**. (Note: it runs on port 8081 to avoid conflicts with other local servers).

To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
